var txt = `Obeisances unto the Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva, directly indicate Lord Çré Kåñëa, who is the divine son of Vasudeva and Devaké. This fact will be more explicitly explained in the text of this work. Çré Vyäsadeva asserts herein that Çré Kåñëa is the original Personality of Godhead, and all others are His direct or indirect plenary portions or portions of the portion. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has even more explicitly explained the subject matter in his Kåñëa-sandarbha. And Brahmä, the original living being, has explained the subject of Çré Kåñëa substantially in his treatise named Brahma-saàhitä. In the Säma-veda Upaniñad, it is also stated that Lord Çré Kåñëa is the divine son of Devaké. Therefore, in this prayer, the first proposition holds that Lord Çré Kåñëa is the primeval Lord, and if any transcendental nomenclature is to be understood as belonging to the Absolute Personality of Godhead, it must be the name indicated by the word Kåñëa, which means the all-attractive. In Bhagavad-gétä, in many places, the Lord asserts Himself to be the original Personality of Godhead, and this is confirmed by Arjuna, and also by great sages like Närada, Vyäsa, and many others. In the Padma Puräëa, it is also stated that out of the innumerable names of the Lord, the name of Kåñëa is the principal one. Väsudeva indicates the plenary portion of the Personality of Godhead, and all the different forms of the Lord, being identical with Väsudeva, are indicated in this text. The name Väsudeva particularly indicates the divine son of Vasudeva and Devaké. Çré Kåñëa is always meditated upon by the paramahaàsas, who are the perfected ones among those in the renounced order of life.
Väsudeva, or Lord Çré Kåñëa, is the cause of all causes. Everything that exists emanates from the Lord. How this is so is explained in later chapters of this work. This work is described by Mahäprabhu Çré Caitanya as the spotless Puräëa because it contains the transcendental narration of the Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa. The history of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam is also very glorious. It was compiled by Çré Vyäsadeva after he had attained maturity in transcendental knowledge. He wrote this under the instructions of Çré Näradajé, his spiritual master. Vyäsadeva compiled all Vedic literatures, containing the four divisions of the Vedas, the Vedänta-sütras (or the Brahma-sütras), the Puräëas, the Mahäbhärata, and so on. But nevertheless he was not satisfied. His dissatisfaction was observed by his spiritual master, and thus Närada advised him to write on the transcendental activities of Lord Çré Kåñëa. These transcendental activities are described specifically in the Tenth Canto of this work. But, in order to reach to the very substance, one must proceed gradually by developing knowledge of the categories.
It is natural that a philosophical mind wants to know about the origin of the creation. At night he sees the stars in the sky, and he naturally speculates about their inhabitants. Such inquiries are natural for man because man has a developed consciousness which is higher than that of the animals. The author of Çrémad-Bhägavatam gives a direct answer to such inquiries. He says that the Lord Çré Kåñëa is the origin of all creations. He is not only the creator of the universe, but the destroyer as well. The manifested cosmic nature is created at a certain period by the will of the Lord. It is maintained for some time, and then it is annihilated by His will. Therefore, the supreme will is behind all cosmic activities. Of course, there are atheists of various categories who do not believe in a creator, but that is due to a poor fund of knowledge. The modern scientist, for example, has created space satellites, and by some arrangement or other, these satellites are thrown into outer space to fly for some time at the control of the scientist who is far away. Similarly, all the universes with innumerable stars and planets are controlled by the intelligence of the Personality of Godhead.
In Vedic literatures, it is said that the Absolute Truth, Personality of Godhead, is the chief amongst all living personalities. All living beings, beginning from the first created being, Brahmä, down to the smallest ant, are individual living beings. And above Brahmä, there are even other living beings with individual capacities, and the Personality of Godhead is also a similar living being. And He is an individual as are the other living beings. But the Supreme Lord, or the supreme living being, has the greatest intelligence, and He possesses supermost inconceivable energies of all different varieties. If a man's brain can produce a space satellite, one can very easily imagine how brains higher than man can produce similarly wonderful things which are far superior. The reasonable person will easily accept this argument, but there are stubborn atheists who would never agree. Çréla Vyäsadeva, however, at once accepts the supreme intelligence as the parameçvara. He offers his respectful obeisances unto the supreme intelligence addressed as the para or the parameçvara or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And that parameçvara is Çré Kåñëa, as admitted in Bhagavad-gétä and other scriptures delivered by Çré Vyäsadeva and specifically in this Çrémad-Bhägavatam. In Bhagavad-gétä, the Lord says that there is no other para-tattva (summum bonum) than Himself. Therefore, Çré Vyäsadeva at once worships the para-tattva, Çré Kåñëa, whose transcendental activities are described in the Tenth Canto.`
